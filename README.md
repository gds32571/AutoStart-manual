# AutoStart
The system which restarts a Raspberry Pi after it has been shutdown due to lightning.

### AutoStart.ino
A program which runs on an ATTiny45 to electrically "push" the start button on a UPS3v2 board to power up the system. The tiny is turned on by the relay which disconnects the 12v wall wart from the UPS.
